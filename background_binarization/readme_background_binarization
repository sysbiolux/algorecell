Statistical analysis developed in the scope of thi project, for binarization with respect to the collected RNA-seq data.
For this statistical analysis, representative background distributions of gene expressions in 67 mouse tissues were generated from ArchS4 data [https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/, Kallisto raw read counts, retrieved 2019]. Independent vertex sampling was performed per tissue to remove correlated samples. Samples were further filtered for overall read counts between 10 and 100 Mio and a median>=1 to remove unusual distributions and outliers. This background data was merged with our own data (after Kallisto alignment) and then quantile normalized and converted to TPM (gene length normalization and TPM scaling). The gene-specific background distributions were then applied for discretization of the own data as follows: Gene expressed in own data below median of background -> 0; above upper quartile -> 1. In addition, genes with TPM<1 are discretized to 0. Furthermore, genes with large expression differences over all samples and time-points were identified via k-means-clustering (2 clusters), with a minimum 3-fold-change of centroid locations, at least 3 data points per cluster, and full-filling a ttest2 (Matlab) between the two clusters. 37 genes were found accordingly. The upper cluster was discretized to 1 and the lower cluster to 0. The respective Matlab code for this statistical analysis is available at: https://github.com/sysbiolux
